# Hire Me

{|<} I'd love to chat about work. If you want to chat, reach out via email (scott@willeke.com) or [![LinkedIn Logo](/_images/linkedin-gray.svg) LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottwilleke/).

I started my career in a startup building software for developers at [Data Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Dynamics) (acquired by [Grape City](https://www.grapecity.com/)). Most recently I was CTO at Vouched.id leading Product & Engineering for the team using Computer Vision AI to verify people's identity. Before that I was Sr. Director of Product & Engineering at [Smartsheet](https://www.smartsheet.com/) supporting the teams building and operating the core platform (Auth, Administration). Over six years, I launched capabilities such as Automated Workflows, Conversations, Home, dozens of integrations, and more. I was also a Product Manager at Amazon Web Services (AWS), Daptiv (acquired by Plan View).

{|<} I love to build things - specially out of code and especially with others. You can see some of my open source activity on [![Github](/_images/github-gray.svg) Github](github.com/activescott) or [![Stack Overflow](/_images/stack-overflow-gray.svg) Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/51061/scott-willeke).

## Availability

I am available for contract positions as a Lead Software Engineer or Lead Product Manager. I welcome individual contributor roles or leading teams of engineers through a project. I will also consider fractional CTO roles for the right team. Over 25 years, I have helped teams navigate challenges with code and operations. I help speed up delivery while improving scalability and reliability.

I also advise on Product Management. Anything from defining product strategy to embedding with engineers to deliver a feature. I can support the C-level with customer research to articulate a product strategy whether they're preparing for their series A or their S-1. I help teams deliver software that customers buy. I do so by clarifying customer needs and making smart tradeoff decisions. I support product launch through close collaboration with marketing, customer success, and sales teams to boost sales and retention. In all cases, I measure my own success by my ability to drive revenue.
