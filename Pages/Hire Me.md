# Hire Me

{|<} I'd love to chat about work. If you want to chat, reach out via email (scott@willeke.com) or [![LinkedIn Logo](/_images/linkedin-gray.svg) LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/scottwilleke/).

I am a motivational leader with strong sense of ownership, always building trust with others. After leading as a software developer for nearly 10 years in a zero-to-one startup, I transitioned to product management. I care as much about developing team members into leaders as I do about developing products customers use and love. I still canâ€™t stop coding in my spare time. I am a regular open source contributor and a top 4% overall contributor on Stack Overflow.

## Experience

{|<} ![award](/_images/award-gray.svg) While I was at Smartsheet, I received a [2020 Tech Up-and-Comer award for my impact](https://www.okta.com/up-and-comers/2020/scott-willeke/).

I started my career in a startup building libraries for developers at [Data Dynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Dynamics) (acquired by [Grape City](https://www.grapecity.com/)). Most recently I was CTO at Vouched.id leading Product & Engineering where we verified people's identity using AI computer vision. Before that I was Sr. Director of Product & Engineering at [Smartsheet](https://www.smartsheet.com/) supporting the teams building and operating the core platform (Auth, Administration). Over six years, I launched capabilities such as Automated Workflows, Conversations, Home, dozens of integrations, and more. I was also a Product Manager at Amazon Web Services (AWS), Daptiv (acquired by Plan View).

{|<} I love to build â€“ especially with others. You can see some of my open source activity on [![Github](/_images/github-gray.svg) Github](https://github.com/activescott) or [![Stack Overflow](/_images/stack-overflow-gray.svg) Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/51061/scott-willeke).

## Technical Skills

Lately I code most with TypeScript/JavaScript, Node.js, React, REST APIs, and various databases. I have operated reliable and secure cloud services at scale and I know my way around AWS, GCP and Kubernetes. I perform deep data analysis in Python/Pandas/Jupyter & SQL. I'm also capable in C#/.NET, C/C++ and I don't shy away from something new and I learn fast. I am comfortable hanging out with the highest-performing front-end, backend and site-reliability engineers.

## Consulting Availability

I consult on **Product Management** and **Software Engineering**.
I am available for contract positions as a **Lead Software Engineer** or **Lead Product Manager**. I welcome individual contributor roles or leading teams of engineers through a project. I will also consider fractional CTO roles for the right team. Over 25 years, I have helped teams navigate challenges with code and operations. I help speed up delivery while improving scalability and reliability.

Anything from defining product strategy to embedding with engineers to deliver a feature. I can support the C-level with customer research to articulate a product strategy whether they're preparing for a seed round or their S-1. I help teams deliver software that customers buy. I do so by clarifying customer needs and making smart tradeoff decisions. I support product launch through close collaboration with marketing, customer success, and sales teams to boost sales and retention. In all cases, I measure my own success by my ability to drive revenue.
