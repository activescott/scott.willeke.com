# About Scott Willeke

I am a family man and software builder living near Seattle, WA in the United States.

I like spending time with family and being outside. See more about my recent trips on [Peakbagger.com](https://peakbagger.com/climber/climber.aspx?cid=37440) or [AllTrails](https://www.alltrails.com/members/scott-willeke-1).

I love to build things - specially out of code and especially with others. You can see some of my related activities on [Github](https://github.com/activescott) or [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/users/51061/scott-willeke).

If you're interested more in my professional interests, or if you want a hand building software with your team, you can check out **[[Hire-Me]]** and [[Projects]].
