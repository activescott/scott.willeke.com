        <h1>Scott Willeke</h1>
        <h2>Product Guy</h2>
        <p>
          Most recently I was <b>CTO</b> leading Product & Engineering at
          <a href="https://www.vouched.id">Vouched</a>. Vouched is an AI-powered
          identity verification company that helps businesses verify the
          identity of their customers in real time.
        </p>
        <p>
          Before that I was Sr. Director of Engineering at
          <a href="https://www.smartsheet.com/" target="_blank">Smartsheet</a>
          where I led the refactoring of Access & Identity services from a
          monolith to scalable microservices that support millions of users with
          predictable performance and rapid incremental deployments. I supported
          the teams growing from ~25 to ~45 engineers. Prior to that I was a
          <b>Sr. Director of Product Management</b> supporting teams that
          envisioned and launched Smartsheet's Automated Workflows offering,
          Conversations, Notifications, core experience navigation, and many
          integrations.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a <b>Senior Product Manager</b>, I also built mobile identity
          services at Amazon Web Services, and I led core platform initiatives
          at
          <a
            href="https://www.planview.com/products-solutions/products/daptiv/"
            target="_blank"
            >Daptiv (now part of Planview)</a
          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          I started my career as a <b>Developer</b> and eventually
          <b>Head of Engineering</b> creating products for developers at
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Dynamics" target="_blank"
            >Data Dynamics</a
          >
          where we created products now sold under GrapeCity including
          <a href="https://www.grapecity.com/activereports" target="_blank"
            >ActiveReports</a
          >
          and DynamiCube. After nearly 10 years, Data Dynamics was acquired by
          <a href="https://www.grapecity.com" target="_blank">GrapeCity</a>
          where I went on to pitch, build, and launch an ActiveReports-based
          product for Enterprise Customers.

              I am available for contract positions as a Lead Software Engineer
              or Lead Product Manager. I welcome individual contributor roles or
              leading teams of engineers through a project. I will also consider
              fractional CTO roles for the right team. Over 25 years, I have
              helped teams navigate challenges with code and operations. I help
              speed up delivery while improving scalability and reliability.
            </p>
            <p>
              I also advise on Product Management. Anything from defining
              product strategy to embedding with engineers to deliver a feature.
              I can support the C-level with customer research to articulate a
              product strategy whether they're preparing for their series A or
              their S-1. I help teams deliver software that customers buy. I do
              so by clarifying customer needs and making smart tradeoff
              decisions. I support product launch through close collaboration
              with marketing, customer success, and sales teams to boost sales
              and retention. In all cases, I measure my own success by my
              ability to drive revenue.
